I'm Fateme, a recent graduate in Computer Architecture from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, BC, Canada. During my studies, I worked as a research assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Alaa Alameldeen](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~alaa/alaa_home.shtml), focusing on system-level research. I am passionate about using my skills in system software development to create effective and innovative solutions.
